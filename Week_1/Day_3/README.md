## Primitive types 
**number**
**string**
**boolean**
**null**
**undefined**
**symbol**

## instanceOf VS typeOf [link for reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/899574/what-is-the-difference-between-typeof-and-instanceof-and-when-should-one-be-used)
1. instanceOf won't work on primitive type, it will always return false
2. typeOf can return primitive type, but for objects, it will just say object. One common bug in JS is null if also return object

## string notions
1. Single quote
2. Double quote
3. Back tick
```
const string = ` one line \n
                then another line`
```
* using back tick is also called template literals so you can have strings in couple of lines. Or we can all also add it with variable. 

## JS class? constructor?

## Use new to construct object, do not just assign var to object because it will just pass the mempory address to the object. So basically they are pointing to the same object

## Call back function
