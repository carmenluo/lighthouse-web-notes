#### Arrow Functions [tutorial Vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=143&v=6sQDTgOqh-I)
**Benefits**
1. Small
2. Inline
3. Single purpose
<br/>*Parameter(if only one paramenter, we can use e to indicate it*
<br/>*return, if only return one statement, it will return implictly without "return"*

#### Higher Order Functions [tutorial Vedio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=595&v=BMUiFMZr7vk)
<br/>
1. Function takes callback function is called Higer Order Functions, or *more accurately, functions operate on other functions, that includes but not limited to the ones take call back functions as parameters*<br/>
2. Functional programming differs from oop is bacause function is also values/objects, that makes our function more composible that we can passing functions around<br/>

| Method        | Difference                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
| bind          | used for callback                      |
| apply         | invoke immediately, single paramter    |
| call          | invoke immediately, multipal parameter |


##### break loops
Array.phototype.foreach could not break, but for...in and for...of should be fine
