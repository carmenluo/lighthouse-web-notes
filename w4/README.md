[tutorial](https://dzone.com/articles/css-position-relative-vs-position-absolute)
1. when we use relative, if we don't specify top, botton, left, right it is not going to have any effect. And it is relative

2. For absolute, if we have parent as relative and child absolute, it is going to absoulte the child based on how the parent 
look.
