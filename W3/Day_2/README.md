#### || and && in a function ####
```
let a = 6 || 0 return 6
let b = "" || null return null
for ||, if the first operand is truthy, it is going to return the first one without evaluating the second one, otherwise it
will return the second one anway.<br/>
for &&, if the first operand is falsey, it is going to return the first one otherwise the second one.
```
